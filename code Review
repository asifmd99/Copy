Code review

private: The method is accessible only within the class it's declared in.
static: The method can be called without creating an instance of the class.
final: The kafkaMessageBuilder reference cannot be changed once assigned.
Assigns a random UUID string as the key for the Kafka message.
These headers provide additional metadata about the message, specifically identifying the source of the message.
----------Sender id and subsection id
Purpose: The SenderApplicationId header is used to identify the application that generated or sent the Kafka message.
Example Usage: In distributed systems, it's common to have multiple applications or services that produce and consume messages.
By including the SenderApplicationId header,
you can easily trace which application produced a specific message.
Purpose: The SenderSubApplicationId header is used to identify a specific sub-section or module within the application that generated or sent the Kafka message.
Example Usage: Within a single application, there may be multiple modules or components responsible for different functionalities.
The SenderSubApplicationId helps in further narrowing down the origin of the message to a specific component or template within the main application.

---------------Final--------
The final keyword in Java is used to declare constants or to ensure that variables, methods, or classes cannot be changed once they have been initialized or defined
This ensures that the value of longAccountEvent remains consistent and cannot be accidentally modified within the method,
enhancing the methodâ€™s reliability and reducing potential bugs.
Advantages
Immutability: Ensures that once a variable is assigned, its reference cannot be changed. This is crucial for creating immutable objects that can be safely shared 
across threads without synchronization.
Clarity: Indicates to the reader and the compiler that the variable, parameter, or method is not supposed to change, making the code easier to understand.
Optimization: Allows the compiler to make certain optimizations knowing that the variable or parameter will not change.
Safety: Prevents accidental reassignment of parameters or variables, reducing the likelihood of bugs.

Declaring a method parameter as final means that within the body of the method, you cannot reassign the parameter to a different object.
When a local variable is declared as final, it means that once the variable is assigned a value, it cannot be reassigned.
This is often used to create immutable objects or to prevent the variable from being reassigned,
ensuring the initial assignment is the only assignment and adding to the predictability of the code.
----------
final LongAccountEvent longAccountEvent: Ensures that within this method, the reference to longAccountEvent cannot be changed.
You can still modify the object's state if it's mutable, but you cannot reassign longAccountEvent to point to another LongAccountEvent object.
final KafkaMessageBuilder<String, LongAccountEvent> kafkaMessageBuilder: Ensures that once kafkaMessageBuilder is assigned a KafkaMessage.builder() instance,
it cannot be reassigned to a different KafkaMessageBuilder object. This makes the code more predictable and easier to follow.
----------------------------Key role in message----------------------------
In Kafka, the key in a message plays a crucial role in determining how messages are distributed across partitions and how consumers process them.
Kafka topics are divided into multiple partitions to allow parallel processing and to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
The key of a Kafka message determines which partition the message will be sent to. Kafka uses a partitioning strategy to map the key to a specific partition.
By default, Kafka uses a hash of the key to determine the partition.
This ensures that all messages with the same key are sent to the same partition, which can be crucial for maintaining the order of messages.
By using a key, you can ensure that all messages related to the same entity
(e.g., all events for a particular user or account) are processed in order, because they will all go to the same partition.
Load Balancing:
ex-This ensures that each message is likely to be distributed across different partitions because each message gets a unique key.
For use cases where related messages need to be sent to the same partition,
a more meaningful key should be used (e.g., user ID, account ID, etc.).

use case-Suppose you have a topic for user events where different types of events (login, logout, update profile) are produced for each user.
Using the user ID as the key ensures that all events for a particular user are sent to the same partition and processed in order.
-------------------------UUID----------------
UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier.
-------------Kafka template config -------------
This is an object that holds configuration properties for Kafka, usually sourced from the application's configuration files 
(like application.yml or application.properties).
These properties might include broker addresses, client IDs, security settings, etc.
