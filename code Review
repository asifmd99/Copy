Code review

private: The method is accessible only within the class it's declared in.
static: The method can be called without creating an instance of the class.
final: The kafkaMessageBuilder reference cannot be changed once assigned.
Assigns a random UUID string as the key for the Kafka message.
These headers provide additional metadata about the message, specifically identifying the source of the message.
----------Sender id and subsection id
Purpose: The SenderApplicationId header is used to identify the application that generated or sent the Kafka message.
Example Usage: In distributed systems, it's common to have multiple applications or services that produce and consume messages.
By including the SenderApplicationId header,
you can easily trace which application produced a specific message.
Purpose: The SenderSubApplicationId header is used to identify a specific sub-section or module within the application that generated or sent the Kafka message.
Example Usage: Within a single application, there may be multiple modules or components responsible for different functionalities.
The SenderSubApplicationId helps in further narrowing down the origin of the message to a specific component or template within the main application.

---------------Final--------
The final keyword in Java is used to declare constants or to ensure that variables, methods, or classes cannot be changed once they have been initialized or defined
This ensures that the value of longAccountEvent remains consistent and cannot be accidentally modified within the method,
enhancing the methodâ€™s reliability and reducing potential bugs.
Advantages
Immutability: Ensures that once a variable is assigned, its reference cannot be changed. This is crucial for creating immutable objects that can be safely shared 
across threads without synchronization.
Clarity: Indicates to the reader and the compiler that the variable, parameter, or method is not supposed to change, making the code easier to understand.
Optimization: Allows the compiler to make certain optimizations knowing that the variable or parameter will not change.
Safety: Prevents accidental reassignment of parameters or variables, reducing the likelihood of bugs.

Declaring a method parameter as final means that within the body of the method, you cannot reassign the parameter to a different object.
When a local variable is declared as final, it means that once the variable is assigned a value, it cannot be reassigned.
This is often used to create immutable objects or to prevent the variable from being reassigned,
ensuring the initial assignment is the only assignment and adding to the predictability of the code.
----------
final LongAccountEvent longAccountEvent: Ensures that within this method, the reference to longAccountEvent cannot be changed.
You can still modify the object's state if it's mutable, but you cannot reassign longAccountEvent to point to another LongAccountEvent object.
final KafkaMessageBuilder<String, LongAccountEvent> kafkaMessageBuilder: Ensures that once kafkaMessageBuilder is assigned a KafkaMessage.builder() instance,
it cannot be reassigned to a different KafkaMessageBuilder object. This makes the code more predictable and easier to follow.
----------------------------Key role in message----------------------------
In Kafka, the key in a message plays a crucial role in determining how messages are distributed across partitions and how consumers process them.
Kafka topics are divided into multiple partitions to allow parallel processing and to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
The key of a Kafka message determines which partition the message will be sent to. Kafka uses a partitioning strategy to map the key to a specific partition.
By default, Kafka uses a hash of the key to determine the partition.
This ensures that all messages with the same key are sent to the same partition, which can be crucial for maintaining the order of messages.
By using a key, you can ensure that all messages related to the same entity
(e.g., all events for a particular user or account) are processed in order, because they will all go to the same partition.
Load Balancing:
ex-This ensures that each message is likely to be distributed across different partitions because each message gets a unique key.
For use cases where related messages need to be sent to the same partition,
a more meaningful key should be used (e.g., user ID, account ID, etc.).

use case-Suppose you have a topic for user events where different types of events (login, logout, update profile) are produced for each user.
Using the user ID as the key ensures that all events for a particular user are sent to the same partition and processed in order.
-------------------------UUID----------------
UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier.
-------------Kafka template config -------------
KafkaProperties properties:

This is an object that holds configuration properties for Kafka,
usually sourced from the application's configuration files (like application.yml or application.properties).
These properties might include broker addresses, client IDs, security settings, etc.

ProducerFactory<Object, Object> kafkaProducerFactory:

This factory produces Kafka producers, which are used to send records to Kafka topics.

ObjectProvider<RecordMessageConverter> messageConverter:

This is a Spring ObjectProvider for RecordMessageConverter, which can be used to convert messages.
It allows for optional injection, meaning the RecordMessageConverter is only used if available.

Creates a new KafkaTemplate instance.
The KafkaTemplate is parameterized with Object, Object, meaning it can handle keys and values of any type.
The ProducerFactory is passed to the KafkaTemplate constructor to create the underlying Kafka producer.
A singleton map is provided to the constructor to configure the producer with a value serializer class (JsonSerializer.class),
ensuring that the Kafka producer uses JSON serialization for message values.
If a RecordMessageConverter is available, it is set on the KafkaTemplate.
This converter might be used to convert messages to and from other formats as needed.
If a KafkaProducerListener is available, it is set on the KafkaTemplate.
This listener can handle various producer events, such as when a message is successfully sent or when an error occurs.

The RecordMessageConverter is an interface in the Spring Kafka framework 
that allows for the conversion of messages to and from different formats when producing or consuming messages in Kafka
. It is typically used to abstract away the serialization and deserialization logic, making it easier to work with different data formats.
The RecordMessageConverter handles converting messages from application-specific types
to ProducerRecord instances when sending messages and vice versa when receiving messages.
ObjectProvider is a Spring interface that allows for optional dependency injection.

The RecordMessageConverter in a KafkaTemplate is a powerful mechanism for handling message serialization and deserialization in a
flexible and modular way.
By optionally injecting and setting the converter,
the KafkaTemplate can support various message formats and ensure that the conversion logic is cleanly separated from the business logic.
This approach enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application.

ByteArrayJsonMessageConverter
This converter is used for scenarios where messages are transmitted as byte arrays:

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.kafka.support.converter.ByteArrayJsonMessageConverter;

@Bean
public RecordMessageConverter messageConverter() {
    return new ByteArrayJsonMessageConverter();
}
Usage:
Similar to StringJsonMessageConverter, but works with byte arrays.
Useful when Kafka messages are sent as byte arrays instead of strings.

----------XMLCALENDATER-----------
Next, create custom converters to convert XMLGregorianCalendar to Date before saving it to MongoDB and vice versa when retrieving it.
-----------Auto Offset Reset----------
In Spring Boot Kafka, auto.offset.reset is a consumer configuration setting that controls the behavior of the consumer
when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if the current offset does not exist anymore on the server
(e.g., because that data has been deleted).

earliest: When the consumer group is first created or if the current offset is invalid,
the consumer will start reading from the beginning of the partition,i.e., the earliest available message.
latest: When the consumer group is first created or if the current offset is invalid,
the consumer will start reading from the end of the partition, i.e.,
it will only receive new messages that are published after the consumer starts.
none: If there is no previous offset for the consumer group,
an exception will be thrown. This can be useful to ensure that no messages are missed by accident.

By setting the auto.offset.reset property, you can control the behavior of your Kafka consumers 
in terms of where they start reading messages when there is no previously committed offset.

-------Kafka Partition-----------
Kafka Partition
A Kafka Partition is a division of a topic that allows for parallelism in data processing.
Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is appended to.

Key Concepts:
Partition: A topic can have multiple partitions. Each partition is an append-only log.
Offset: Each record in a partition has an offset, which is a unique identifier for the record within the partition.
Leader and Replicas: Each partition has one leader and zero or more replicas for fault tolerance.

Different consumer groups consume independently from the same topic.
Consuming Messages
When messages are produced to the orders topic, the consumers in different groups will consume them independently.

Consumer Group group-A:

Consumer A1 and Consumer A2 will each consume messages from the partitions assigned to them by Kafka.
They will both consume messages but not the same messages.
Consumer Group group-B:

Consumer B1 and Consumer B2 will also consume messages independently from group-A. 
They will process the same messages but manage their offsets separately.

            System.out.println("Received Order: " + order);
        } else if (message instanceof Payment) {
            Payment payment = (Payment) message;
            System.out.println("Received Payment: " + payment);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Received Unknown Message: " + message);
        }
    }
