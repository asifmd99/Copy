### Components Description

#### 1. Polling Agent

**Role:**  
The polling agent is responsible for monitoring the log file for updates. It regularly checks for new entries and processes them.

**Functionality:**
- **Initialization:** Sets up the necessary environment, initializes configurations, and prepares to monitor the log file.
- **Polling Mechanism:** Periodically reads the log file to detect new entries. This can be done using a scheduled task or a continuous loop with a sleep interval.
- **Log Processing:** Once new entries are detected, the polling agent processes these entries and prepares them for further handling by other components.

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize()`: Sets up configurations and prepares the agent.
- `poll()`: Continuously monitors the log file for new entries.
- `processLogEntry(LogEntry entry)`: Processes each new log entry.

5. **MongoDB Storage:** The enriched data is then stored in MongoDB for further use and analysis.

By providing these detailed descriptions, anyone reading the documentation will have a clear understanding of each component's role and how they interact within the system.

_----------------------------------------
### 1. Polling Agent

**Role:**
The polling agent is responsible for monitoring the log file for any updates using an event-driven approach. It uses a watch service to detect changes to the log file and triggers appropriate actions when updates are detected.

**Functionality:**
- **Initialization:** Sets up the necessary environment, initializes configurations, and prepares the watch service to monitor the log file.
- **Watch Service:** Utilizes Java's `WatchService` API to monitor the log file for any modifications, such as new entries.
- **Event Handling:** When a change is detected, the watch service triggers an event, and the polling agent processes the new log entries.

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize()`: Sets up configurations and prepares the agent.
- `setupWatchService()`: Configures and initializes the watch service to monitor the log file.
- `handleWatchEvent(WatchEvent<?> event)`: Processes the event triggered by the watch service when a change is detected in the log file.
- `processLogEntry(LogEntry entry)`: Processes each new log entry detected by the watch service.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class PollingAgent {

    private WatchService watchService;
    private Path logFilePath;

    public void initialize() throws IOException {
        // Set up configurations
        setupWatchService();
    }

    private void setupWatchService() throws IOException {
        watchService = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService();
        logFilePath = Paths.get("/path/to/log/file");
        logFilePath.getParent().register(watchService, StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_MODIFY);
    }

    public void startMonitoring() {
        while (true) {
            WatchKey key;
            try {
                key = watchService.take();
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                return;
            }

            for (WatchEvent<?> event : key.pollEvents()) {
                handleWatchEvent(event);
            }

            boolean valid = key.reset();
            if (!valid) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    private void handleWatchEvent(WatchEvent<?> event) {
        WatchEvent.Kind<?> kind = event.kind();
        if (kind == StandardWatchEventKinds.OVERFLOW) {
            return;
        }

        WatchEvent<Path> ev = (WatchEvent<Path>) event;
        Path filename = ev.context();

        if (filename.equals(logFilePath.getFileName())) {
            // Process new log entry
            processLogEntry(/*new log entry*/);
        }
    }

    private void processLogEntry(LogEntry entry) {
        // Process the log entry
    }
}
```

In this revised description, the polling agent is now event-driven, using the `WatchService` API to monitor the log file for changes. When changes are detected, it processes the new entries accordingly. This approach ensures efficient and real-time monitoring of the log file.

### 2. Kafka Producer

**Role:**
The Kafka producer is responsible for sending processed log entries to a Kafka topic. It handles log events, parses them, populates the appropriate Java classes, and constructs Kafka messages with metadata before sending them to the specified topic.

**Functionality:**
- **Initialization:** Configures the Kafka producer with necessary settings such as bootstrap servers, key serializer, and value serializer.
- **Log Event Processing:** Splits the log event by a delimiter and sets the field values for either `AccountEvent` or `LongAccountEvent` based on the size of the split data.
- **Message Building:** Creates a message builder, adds metadata, and constructs the Kafka message.
- **Message Production:** Sends the constructed message to the specified Kafka topic.

**Key Methods:**
- `configureProducer()`: Sets up the producer configurations.
- `processLogEvent(String logEvent)`: Processes the log event, splits it, populates the appropriate Java class, and builds the Kafka message.
- `sendMessage(String topic, String message)`: Sends a constructed message to the specified Kafka topic.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;

import java.util.Properties;

public class LogKafkaProducer {

    private KafkaProducer<String, String> producer;

    public void configureProducer() {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
    }

    public void processLogEvent(String logEvent) {
        String delimiter = "|";
        String[] parts = logEvent.split(delimiter);

        if (parts.length == expectedLengthForAccountEvent()) {
            AccountEvent event = new AccountEvent();
            event.setField1(parts[0]);
            event.setField2(parts[1]);
            // Set other fields...

            String message = buildMessage(event);
            sendMessage("account_topic", message);

        } else if (parts.length == expectedLengthForLongAccountEvent()) {
            LongAccountEvent event = new LongAccountEvent();
            event.setField1(parts[0]);
            event.setField2(parts[1]);
            // Set other fields...

            String message = buildMessage(event);
            sendMessage("long_account_topic", message);
        }
    }

    private String buildMessage(Object event) {
        // Convert the event object to a JSON string (or other format) and add metadata
        String metadata = "meta_data";
        return metadata + "|" + event.toString();
    }

    private void sendMessage(String topic, String message) {
        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, message);
        producer.send(record);
    }

    private int expectedLengthForAccountEvent() {
        return 5; // Replace with actual length
    }

    private int expectedLengthForLongAccountEvent() {
        return 10; // Replace with actual length
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initialization:** The `configureProducer()` method sets up the Kafka producer with necessary configurations.
- **Log Event Processing:** The `processLogEvent(String logEvent)` method processes log events. It splits the log event string by the delimiter, checks the size of the resulting array, and sets the fields of either `AccountEvent` or `LongAccountEvent` accordingly.
- **Message Building:** The `buildMessage(Object event)` method constructs the message string by combining metadata with the event's string representation.
- **Message Production:** The `sendMessage(String topic, String message)` method sends the constructed message to the specified Kafka topic.

By providing this detailed description, readers will understand how the Kafka producer processes log events, populates the appropriate Java classes, builds messages with metadata, and sends them to Kafka topics.

### Introduction

In the fast-paced world of banking, real-time data processing is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and gaining valuable insights. To address this need, we have developed a robust Java agent designed to monitor a bank's log file for updates continuously. This agent ensures that any changes to the log file are detected and processed in real-time, enabling immediate action and analysis.

Upon detecting updates, the agent processes these log entries and produces them to a Kafka topic. Kafka, known for its high throughput and low latency, facilitates the efficient and reliable transmission of log data in real-time.

The processed data is then enriched using a SOAP API and stored in MongoDB, a NoSQL database optimized for handling large volumes of unstructured data. This storage solution allows for detailed analytics, reporting, and data-driven decision-making by the bank.

Our solution leverages modern technologies to provide a seamless and efficient way to handle real-time log data, ensuring that the bank can maintain high performance and gain valuable insights from their operational data. This project exemplifies the integration of event-driven architecture, real-time data processing, and scalable data storage to meet the demanding needs of the banking industry.
